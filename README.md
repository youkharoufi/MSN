# MSN

MSN is a chat application in which you can as a user send friend requests, accept or deny them, and chat with your friends via a SignalR based chat.

## Installation
To start using the app, all you have to do is :

```
add-migration InitialMigration
update-database
```

## Usage

You can see that there are seed users already to help you use the app without having to register with your actual email address.
If you do choose to register with your email address, you will receive a confirmation email with a link that you will have
to click in order to use the app.

## Rules

You can only chat once you have sent an invitation (or friend request) and accepted it with the receiving user. You can connect to all 3 
of the seeded users by entering their usernames (Youssef, Henry and Estelle). As for the password, it is the same for all 3 users : 1234
